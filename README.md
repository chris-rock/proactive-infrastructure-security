# Proactive Infrastructure Security

> NOTE: This repository is going to be further updated to describe the journey
> of implementing proactive infrastructure security

## Abstract

As cyberattacks become increasingly automated, it's essential to protect our infrastructure before deployment. This proactive approach is critical to maintaining the integrity and security of our systems. This talk will explore:

- Security by Design: Establishing a foundational security-first approach throughout the development lifecycle.
- SBOM Integration: Using Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) within container and VM image build pipelines to ensure comprehensive security oversight.
- Metadata Collection: Strategies for collecting and storing SBOM data in metadata repositories to enhance traceability and compliance.
- IaC & Policy as Code: Leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Policy as Code to automate and enforce security policies consistently.
- Static Code Analysis: Implementing static code analysis to detect vulnerabilities early in the development process.

Participants will learn:
- Security by Design Principles: Practical concepts and strategies to embed security throughout the design and development phases.
- IaC and Policy as Code Integration: How to effectively combine IaC and Policy as Code to automate and enforce security measures, ensuring consistent compliance and reduced risk.
